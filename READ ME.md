To install this Currency Converter Widget, make sure that 
index.html, script.js, and style.css are in the same folder, 
(preferably named CurrencyConverter though it does not matter), 
and then open index.html in a web browser.  Left-click on 
index.html and click 'Open With' and select the web browser.  

Initial and converted currency begin as CAD, but are changed 
when a user clicks on a different currency listed when selected
from the drop down menus.
